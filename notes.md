i have the windows set up,

now we need to render graphics onto it

we have two choices that will dictate the architecture of the renderer
we can use OpenGL for the rendering(manual and we need to take care of the
steps during the pipeline, buffers, and memory) or we can use SDL's rendering
API via SDL_CreateRenderer
