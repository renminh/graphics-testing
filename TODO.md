# TODO

understand what VBO and VAO are in terms of buffers?
or vertex shaders, currently what i do understand is that

the vertex shader takes in vertices based on the glBufferData
and  i assume that this data is binded to the VBO? (why?)

the vertex shader is what creates the vertices and primitive shapes

---

for the actual architecture, learn about Data-Oriented Design especially since
it wraps around Entity Component System for the game engine architecture
